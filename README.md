# Shippers Technical Test Project / Front-End

[Go to back-end repo of this project](https://github.com/egulhan/shippers-technical-test-back-end)

## Project setup

1. Download the source code to your machine.<br><br>

2. Create an environment file called .env under the root directory. You can create it from .env.example like below:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

**HEADS UP:** In case you make the back-end app up with the command **php artisan serve**, you can keep the .env file
content as it is. Otherwise, you need update .env file content based on your back-end server setup.<br>

3. Install NPM packages:

```
npm install
```

4. Compile code and run the app:

```
npm run serve
```

You're done with the setup. Now you can visit http://localhost:8080/
